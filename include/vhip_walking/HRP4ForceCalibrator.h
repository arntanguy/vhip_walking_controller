  /** Calibration routine due to an unmodeled coupling between ground reaction
   * force and torque measurements on HRP-4.
   *
   * This estimator is based on Polyak averaging, see
   * <https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/81783/259718>.
   *
   * The notations use here are \f$y = F_z\f$ and \f$x = (T_x, T_y, 1)\f$ so
   * that:
   *
   * \f$ F_z = \theta_0 T_x + \theta_1 T_y + \theta_2\f$
   *
   * Measurements are supposed to be conducted with the robot standing still on
   * the ground, with the user pushing it horizontally but not vertically. This
   * way, \f$\theta_2\f$ converges to the actual (constant) vertical force, while
   * \f$(\theta_0, \theta_1)\f$ capture linear correlations in \f$(F_z, T_x,
   * T_y)\f$.
